### Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (1948)

**Description:**  
In 1948, *Norbert Wiener*, an American mathematician and philosopher, published **“Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.”** This groundbreaking work introduced the concept of feedback loops in both biological and mechanical systems. Wiener argued that intelligent behavior could emerge from systems that process information and adapt based on feedback—an idea that deeply influenced the development of AI, robotics, and machine learning.

**Why It Matters:**  
Cybernetics laid the foundation for understanding how machines could learn and self-regulate. Wiener’s work helped bridge the gap between biology, engineering, and computing, and inspired early AI researchers to explore adaptive systems and intelligent control.
